# Angularin/ng-base-boilerplate

Angularin's base boilerplate for fast, scalable Angular apps. Built with the latest Angular features and AI-assisted workflows to help developers code smarter and follow best practices.

This boilerplate focuses on foundational tooling only—no page features like login or navigation (those will be created separately). It provides a minimal, well-configured starting point with AI integration baked in.
